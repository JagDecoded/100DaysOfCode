# 100DaysOfCode
### Code for at least an hour every day. Share your progress. Keep coding.

## Introduction
I am a code newbie.  
Long before I decided to explore Machine Learning world.
My plan was to start learning, get a job in this field. So I can face real world problems, learn from them and make myself better.
I started working for that. But my progress was too slow. I searched for ways to keep myself in track to learn aggressively. I found 100DaysOfCode Challenge few days before, tried it randomly and found helpful.
So officially I am going to start my 100DaysOfCode Challenge (started today - 07th Oct 2017 and it will end on 12th Jan 2018 [My Birthday]).
